# Complete Classical-Quantum Relational Hoare Logics

This is the project repository for cqotl.

## Structure
- `generator`: the verification condition generator in OCaml
- `lean-veri`: the formalization of theories for verification conditions in Lean

## Setup & Installation

### Running the Dune Project in `generator/`

#### Prerequisites
- **OCaml** (version 4.12.0 or later recommended)
- **Dune** (version 2.9.0 or later)
- **opam** (for dependency management)
- **Menhir** (version 3.0 or later)
#### Setup and Execution

1. Navigate to the `generator` directory:
   ```bash
   cd generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    opam install . --deps-only
    ```

3. Build and run:
    ```bash
    dune build && dune exec filewatcher source status
    ```
## Usage of CQOTL
The prover executable accepts two command line argument as the source input and status output file. To start the prover, navigate to `generator` folder and run
```
dune exec filewatcher source status
```
This will create two text files `generator/source` and `generator/status`. The prover will monitor the changes made to the source file and the response will be written to the output file.
